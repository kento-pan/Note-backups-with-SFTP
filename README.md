# Note backups with SFTP

This is a little tool I made to access my plaintext notes from everywhere. It connects to the SFTP server (has to be configured in the ```sftp_config.py```) and let's you up- & download files from your SFTP server.
Files will be AES encrypted before the upload, and decrypted after the download.
